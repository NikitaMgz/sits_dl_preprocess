When executing "python3 sits.dl.preprocess.py", the error 
"Initial EE initialization failed, attempting authentication: Caller does not have required permission to use project ee-antoinesaget. Grant the caller the roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer role, or a custom role with the serviceusage.services.use permission, by visiting https://console.developers.google.com/iam-admin/iam/project?project=ee-antoinesaget and then retry. Propagation of the new permission may take a few minutes." is found.
To fix it, we need to create a new project on google earth engine, and change the current name of the project in  the "initialize_earth_engine" function to the new project's name
